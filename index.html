            <P>The public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire.
                 Men often wear Jodhpurs and various types of vest; they carry the Ethiopian
                  flag and various patriotic banners and placards, as well as traditional
                   Ethiopian shields and swords called Shotel. Women dress up in different
                    patterns of handcrafted traditional Ethiopian clothing, known in Amharic
                     as Habesha kemis. Some wear black gowns over all, while others put royal 
                     crowns on their heads. Women's styles of dress, like their male counterparts,
                      imitate the traditional styles of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular
                       note is the dominant presence of the Empress 
                Taytu Betul during these celebrations.[66][67]</p>
